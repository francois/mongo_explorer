h1. Mongo Explorer

A simple Cocoa application to administer Mongo databases. This project is just starting, so please be lenient. My skills with Cocoa are also bare-bones: if you have suggestions on how to make this better, please get in touch.

h2. TODO

Everything?!?

* Connect to the DB, as opposed to just have a GUI;
* Display documents hierarchically (nested documents);
* Paginate or efficiently work with many, many documents;
* Query interface against a DB / collection;
* Think about UI paradigms;
* Copy/Paste documents between databases / collections;

h2. How to contribute?

* Fork this repository
* Make your changes
* Send a pull request
